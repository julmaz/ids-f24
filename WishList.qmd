Difficulties 

* Working with directories and ensuring your virtual enviroment was correct
* Downloading the requirements.txt doc. Was able to overcome by ensuring I was in the correct directory when downloading it.
* For the render quarto, I did not have all the packages and the correct MikTex downloaded so had to make sure all of those were installed into my computer. 
* Working with git and learning how to contribute to the classnotes in a way that can be seen. I remained patient in trying to understand the commands I was doing and not just going through the motions.
